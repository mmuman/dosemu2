# Select cpu virtualization mode.
# "vm86" - use v86 mode via vm86() syscall. Only available on x86-32.
# "kvm" - use KVM, hardware-assisted in-kernel virtual machine.
# "emulated" - use CPU emulator
# "auto" - select whatever works
# Default: "auto"

# 0 - jit; 1 - interpreter
# jit is faster, interpreter is probably more compatible.

## Disk and file system settings

# List of hdimages or directories under ~/.dosemu, or specified
# with an absolute path.
#
# For older versions of MS-DOS and PC-DOS you may want to limit the size of
# any directory-mode virtual disks, or the OS may fail to recognise them:
# /path/to/dir:hdtype1 - creates 10mb IBM type1 disk with C/H/S of 306/4/17
# /path/to/dir:hdtype2 - creates 21mb IBM type2 disk with C/H/S of 615/4/17
# /path/to/dir:hdtype9 - creates 117mb IBM type9 disk with C/H/S of 900/15/17
#
# You can reference the pre-defined path groups with '+' sign followed
# by the number of the group. Currently the following groups are defined:
#   Group 0: user's main drives. This group consists of just one path that
#     should normally be mapped to drive C. You can omit that group if you
#     want to map your own directory to drive C.
#   Group 1: utility/configs & boot drives. This group includes multiple
#     paths that you can map to any drive letters. This group provides the
#     boot files, dosemu-specific drivers and utilities, and the shell.
#   Group 2: utility/configs drive only. This is for non-default setups
#     where DOS was manually installed to drive C, and boot drives are
#     not needed.
# Warning: You need to map group 1 or the boot may fail.
#
# Example: "+0 drives/* +1" means assign group 0 path to drive C,
# then map the content of ~/.dosemu/drives, then map group 1 to
# the consecutive drive letters.
# dosemu1-compatible setup may look like "drives/*".
#
# Some drive letters can be skipped during boot, for example if you
# want to redirect them later. Use '-' sign followed by the amount
# of drive letters to skip.
# Example: "+0 -2 +1" means assign group 0 path to drive C, skip 2
# letters (D, E), then map group 1.
# Note that letter skipping only works correctly with fdpp.
#
# Folders can be mapped to drive letters using full paths.
# Example: "+0 /home/<USERNAME> drives/* -3 +1" means
# assign group 0 to drive C; assign your Home folder to drive D; 
# assign folders in ~/.dosemu/drives to drive letters (for example,
# ~/.dosemu/drives/drive_e and ~/.dosemu/drives/drive_f will be 
# E and F); skip 3 letters (G, H, I); map group 1 to J, K, and L.
#
# Default: "+0 +1" (map both groups of paths to the consecutive drives)

# $_hdimage = "+0 +1"

# Floppy drives.
# May be set up to directory or to /dev/fdX device node.
# Optionally the device type may be appended, such as
# "/dev/fd0:threeinch".
# A directory can be used as a read-only virtual floppy: "floppy_dir:threeinch",
# in which case $HOME/.dosemu/floppy_dir will be used as a floppy image.
# To boot from a floppy, use "boot" keyword, such as:
# $_floppy_a = "dos33.img:boot"
# Note that $_bootdrive overrides the floppy boot flag.
#
# Default: "/dev/fd0:threeinch" for A:, "" for B:

# $_floppy_a = "/dev/fd0:threeinch"
# $_floppy_b = ""

# select the boot drive
# Default: "" (which means auto, finds the first bootable drive)

# $_bootdrive = ""

# swap drives the way the bootdrive to become C
# Needed for DOSes that can't boot from anything other than C drive.
# Default: off

# $_swap_bootdrive = (off)

# list of host directories to present as DOS drives.
# These drives are "light-weight": they cannot be used for boot-up and
# do not take the precious start-up time to create ($_hdimage directory
# drives can take noticeable start-up time).
# You can use the "dir:flag" syntax for some extra functionality.
# The following flags are defined:
# "r" - drive will be read-only.
# "c" - drive will emulate a cdrom.
# "g" - define a group of dynamic drives for removable medias.
#
# Example: $_hostfs_drives = "~/dos /run/media/$USER:g"
#   creates the DOS drive for $HOME/dos and a drive group for
#   removable medias at /run/media/$USER.
# It is recommended to put drive groups at the end of the list.
#
# Default: "" (disabled for security reasons)

# $_hostfs_drives = ""

# List of CDROM devices. Up to 4 are supported. You may also specify
# image files. You need to load cdrom.sys and mscdex/nwcdex/shsucdx.exe.

# Some dumb programs probe the file lock limit by applying locks
# in a loop and checking for an error. The unlimited amount of

# To avoid that, we set the maximum allowed locks number to 1024.

# Default: auto (means: enable only for dumb video mode)

# $_umb_b0 = (auto)

# Enable 32K UMB at 0xb8000.
# This is the text-mode video memory.

# Default: on

# $_hma = (on)

# Default: 1 (use only UMB, minor incompatibilities)

# $_dos_up = (1)

# EMS (expanded memory) size in Kbytes;

# Note: you can use any file here, eg fifo or even a regular file.
# In case of reading a regular file, don't forget to put ^Z (0x1a)
# at the end or there will be no EOF.
#
# "pseudo" keyword may be used to force the pseudo-TTY mode.
# A wrong but quick way to bypass the hardware flow control.
#
# "rtscts" keyword may be used as a wrong but quick way to enforce the
# hardware flow control.
#
# "virtual" keyword may be used to redirect the COM port to the terminal.
# A wrong but quick way for the sysop to play his BBS door games locally.
#
# "exec <command>" execute command <command> and pipe it to the serial port.
# For example "exec rxvt -pty-fd 0" launches rxvt that can communicate
# with that serial port. Can also be used to play door games locally.
#
# "pts <name>" create pts <name> and attach its pty to serial port.
# For example "pts /tmp/com1" creates /tmp/com1 for communicating
# with the serial port.
#
# "mouse" keyword enables the serial mouse emulation on the specified port.
# You can then use native mouse driver, like mouse.com.
# Note: if you configured this as a second mouse ($_mouse_internal = (on)),
# then this secondary serial mouse will use the device specified in
## $_mouse_dev. In that case the primary mouse source should be device-less,
# i.e. SDL, X, xterm, gpm. The configurations with 2 device-less mices
# or with 2 mices both reading different devices are not supported.
#
# "vmodem" keyword enables the modem emulation on the specified port.
# You can then dial to the IP addresses, which will establish the telnet
# connection.
#
# "nullmodem <port_num>" - connect this port to port <port_num> with a
# null-modem cable. You need to also set up port <port_num> and connect
# it to this port the same way.
#
# "ro" - read-only. Write to the port is ignored unless the option below
